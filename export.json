            "From feathery costumes, elaborate parade floats to a non-stop extravaganza of drums, dance and debauchery, few things say festivity like ‘Carnival’! Although it’s celebrated right across Brazil and other Catholic countries, Rio de Janeiro has long been regarded as the place to experience Carnival, drawing millions of event-goers every year.",

            "Translated to ‘Day of the Dead’, this seemingly morbid festivity is a day to celebrate and remember those who have passed away with parades, costumes, paper decorations and edible skulls. It is believed that the spirits of the dead visit their families on October 31 and leave on November 2, so many spend this time visiting cemeteries – where there is often music and dances to honour the spirits.",
